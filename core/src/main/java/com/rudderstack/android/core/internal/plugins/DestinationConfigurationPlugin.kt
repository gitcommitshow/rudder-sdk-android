 * Enables or disables destination plugins based on server config.
 * There can be three cases.
 * In case there is no device mode plugins, there will be no checking for Destination configuration.
 *
 * In case device mode plugins are present but no destination configuration, destination plugins will
 * be removed (though this scenario is very hard to produce, since as device mode plugins are required to
 * setup when server config is available), else it is responsibility of other plugins to do the same.
 *
 * In case device mode destination plugins are present along with server config, all destination
 * plugins that are disabled in destination config are filtered out.
