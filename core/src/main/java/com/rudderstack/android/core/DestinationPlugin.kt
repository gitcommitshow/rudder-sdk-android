 * Destination Plugins are those plugin extensions that are used to send data to device mode

 * [Plugin.intercept] is called with a copy of the original message.
 * [PluginInterceptor] works on this copied message.
 * But when [Plugin.Chain.proceed] is called, internally the copied message is replaced by the
 * original message thus discarding all the changes DestinationPlugin and it's sub-plugins did on the
 * message.
 * This is to safeguard against changes for one destination being propagated to other destination.
 * For propagating changes in Message, use general plugin.
